                The goal of the project was to replace the legacy content delivering system by high-performant cloud-based distributed one. Main requirements were a high performance of delivering content that was achieved by using regional content delivery servers and data-driven approach to present products stored content related to. Similar to the YouTube Thumbnails approach was used for storing a big number of small pictures: using a GCP Bigtable. System surveillance (monitoring, logging, performance measurement) also was based on special GCP service: GCP Spanner.

                The project aimed to improve the performance of existing e-commerce system transitioned from another vendor. The client tried to replace his legacy (more than 20-year-old) system with a new one based on SAP E-commerce platforms. But implemented by third-party vendor first version of a new system suffered from the poor performance: it was able to maintain only 0.5% of the predicted load on production. After different performance tweaks (different level cache optimization, disassembling to separate service and making them redundant to guarantee higher performance, decreasing number of calls to third party system, decreasing number of calls from front-end to back-end, etc.) the system successfully replaced legacy one.

                The client made the marketing investigation and realized that it takes about 20 minutes for users to receive their orders when they come to pick up points. That was considered as quite long. The solution was to introduce service to integrate with third-party automated pickup system with the opportunity to change this system with minimal cost. As far as the client has more than 500 pickup points in Canada, the decent initial data migration to pick up system was required. The introduced adapter-based appliance was able to change or add more pickup system vendors. Development included changes to multiple systems: order management subsystem, client web and mobile interfaces and pick up point works web and mobile interfaces. Project successfully accomplished the integration of automated pickup devices to already existing e-commerce solution. The solution was documented according to client standards and transitioned to support team.

                Project was a software part of medical complex comprises hardware devices, mobile applications, cloud part and computational appliance. The solution was intended to monitor the expectant mother body and discover the pulse of the fetus. The main difference between it and already existing solution is that monitoring is passive. Main challenge was storing, validating and analysis of the huge amount of data (about 2 GB for each patient per day). Another significant requirement was integrating with MATLAB based computational systems to perform calculations, storing results, handling different types of fails and failures.
